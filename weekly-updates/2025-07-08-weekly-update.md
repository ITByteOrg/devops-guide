## Weekly Update — July 8, 2025

It’s been a productive and reflective week across the devops repositories. I’ve started documenting updates to capture not just what gets completed, but how decisions and workflows evolve. This format gives me space to track what’s been applied, highlight where things can improve, and keep a steady rhythm of iteration. It’s part accountability, part running log, and something I hope sharpens future planning.

### Completed
- Debugged TruffleHog integration in devops-security and finalized PR #8
- Migrated general repo documentation to devops-guide, focusing on security-tools.md
- Refactored LoggingUtils to support modular scripting across repositories
- Drafted initial weekly summary and created a Python script to auto-generate a table of contents

### In Progress
- Clean up broken links in documentation and start weekly updates 
- Planning reusable Markdown template for Swimm transition later

### Lessons Learned
- Git merge vs rebase implications on PR workflow and commit logs
- Tradeoffs between short-lived vs long-lived branches for modular teams
- How aggressive squash and drop strategies impact future branching decisions

### Next Week’s Priorities
- Confirm Terraform is working as expected in devops-infra
