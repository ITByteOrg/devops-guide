4️. Create a `.gitignore` File  
   Certain files and directories should be excluded from version control to keep your repository clean. The contents of `.gitignore` depend on the tools and applications used in your project. Here are some common examples:  
   - **Obsidian** → `.obsidian/` (stores workspace settings)  
   - **Visual Studio** → `.vs/`, `bin/`, `obj/` (temporary build files)  
   - **Node.js Projects** → `node_modules/` (dependencies)  
   - **Python Projects** → `__pycache__/`, `.venv/` (virtual environments)  
   - **General System Files** → `.DS_Store` (macOS), `Thumbs.db` (Windows)  

   If you're unsure what to include, you can ask AI for `.gitignore` recommendations based on your project type or check GitHub’s official `.gitignore` templates. It’s best to wait until you create your first file using your software and tools—then, you can use AI to generate `.gitignore` entries based on the exact folders created.
