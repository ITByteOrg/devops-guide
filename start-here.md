# My DevOps Journey

## Introduction

At my previous role in a large enterprise, I inherited a monolithic application with an existing DevOps CI/CD pipeline. The company had strict software usage policies, limiting us to specific tools and even restricting certain features.

Now, I‚Äôm embarking on a personal journey to build a complete DevOps workflow from scratch, ensuring full control over every aspect of the pipeline. This documentation captures my workflow, decisions, and lessons learned along the way.

To make this project accessible as a learning experience, I‚Äôve selected tools that allow the creation of free accounts whenever possible. This way, anyone can replicate this setup as a training session, gaining hands-on experience without financial barriers.

## Documenting the Process

Instead of duplicating existing step-by-step guides, this documentation provides a **high-level overview** of key processes while allowing room for customization based on individual needs.  

üìå If you require specific instructions on a particular GitHub action, searching online will provide the **most up-to-date information**, ensuring you have access to the latest best practices and tools.
