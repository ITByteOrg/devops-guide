# **Setup GitHub Repositories (Overview)**

Before proceeding, ensure that you have successfully created your **GitHub account**. If you havenâ€™t, refer to the **previous section** before continuing.  

## **Repository Structure**  
This guide outlines how to set up repositories as part of a **complete DevOps workflow**, ensuring proper organization and version control.  

### **Repos to Create**  
Below are the repositories that will be created, each serving a distinct purpose within the DevOps framework:  

| **REPOSITORY NAME** | **DESCRIPTION**                                                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `devops-world`      | Python application code, CI/CD workflows, dependencies                                |
| `devops-infra`      | Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible), Kubernetes manifests, cloud provisioning |
| `devops-security`   | Configurations for SonarQube, Checkmarx, Prisma, and other security scanning tools    |
| `devops-monitoring` | Prometheus and Grafana dashboards, alerting rules                                     |
| `devops-ahk`        | Automation scripts for efficiency                                                     |
## **Choose Your Approach**

There are multiple ways to set up repositories. Below are some common approaches. Choose the method that best fits your workflow:

### **Option 1: Manually Setting Up Repositories in GitHub**

â–  Best for **those who prefer using the GitHub web interface** 
â–  Requires **manual repo creation and configuration** 
â–  No CLI tools neededâ€”everything is done via GitHub UI

ðŸ“Œ _See the_ [Manual Setup in GitHub](manual-github-setup.md) _section for details._

### **Option 2: BASH Automation (Recommended for Efficiency)**

â–  Best for **bulk repo creation** with minimal manual work 
â–  Uses **GitHub CLI (**`gh`**)** for automation 
â–  Requires a **Personal Access Token (PAT) for authentication**

âš¡ **Want a faster way to create repositories?** Instead of manually creating each repo, this method **automates the process with a BASH script**. It streamlines repository creation, ensuring consistency and repeatability in DevOps workflows.

ðŸ“Œ _See the_ [Setting Up Repositories Using BASH](bash-repo-setup.md) _guide for details._

## **Which One Should You Use?**

- **Use BASH automation** for **efficiency and bulk repo creation**    
- **Use Git commands** when **duplicating existing repositories**    
- **Use GitHubâ€™s web interface** if you **prefer a hands-on, manual setup**
- _Other tools, such as GitHub Desktop, also provide ways to manage repositories. While not covered in this document, they may be useful depending on your workflow._
