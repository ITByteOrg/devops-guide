## Weekly Update — July 16, 2025

It was a week of consolidating security tooling across repos while reinforcing modular responsibilities and validation paths. The `devops-security` repo saw stabilization work ahead of CI enforcement, while `devops-world` continued to serve as the orchestration layer for developer-side scans and automation.

### Completed
- Merged finalized TruffleHog config into `devops-security` (`PR #10`)
- Updated `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with synced hook references
- Confirmed PowerShell hook boundaries are independent of centralized CI scans
- Refined native hook script resolution in `scripts/githooks/`

### In Progress
- Drafting `branch-protection.md` for `devops-security`
- Updating `CONTRIBUTING.md` to explicitly clarify hook registration workflows
- Validating TruffleHog triggers in CI-only mode across test repos

### Lessons Learned
- Hook wiring in `devops-world` must remain portable. TruffleHog runs locally, not imported from `devops-security`
- Git hook registration is not guaranteed across clones unless bootstrapped explicitly

### Next Week’s Priorities
- Address issue with `security-scan` failing  
  Investigate error modes and confirm TruffleHog flags, Docker runtime, and path resolution.

- Expand functionality of `Resolve-ModulePath` and factor it into other scripts  
  Refactor to support nested module discovery and consistent usage across bootstrap, hook, and validation logic.

- Create a `Write-ConsoleBanner` module to standardize `Write-Host` usage  
  Extract logging behavior into a reusable utility and apply across environment checks, hook scripts, and setup flows.
  
- Add `TruffleHogGitScan` to scan commit messages for secrets  
  Build logic to inspect staged commit messages during hook execution and integrate into local scan pipeline.
